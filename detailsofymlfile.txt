## 1️⃣ `name: Simple Python Action`

```yaml
name: Simple Python Action
```

* This is the **workflow name**
* It appears in the **GitHub → Actions tab**
* You can name it anything (e.g., `Python CI`, `Run Python Script`)

---

## 2️⃣ `on: [push]`

```yaml
on: [push]
```

* This tells GitHub **when to run the workflow**
* Here, it runs **every time you push code** to the repository
* Example triggers:

  * `push`
  * `pull_request`
  * `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger)

---

## 3️⃣ `jobs:` section

```yaml
jobs:
  run-python:
```

* A **job** is a set of steps executed together
* `run-python` is the **job name**
* You can have multiple jobs (build, test, deploy, etc.)

---

## 4️⃣ `runs-on: ubuntu-latest`

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

* Specifies the **virtual machine** where the job runs
* `ubuntu-latest` = Linux machine provided by GitHub
* Other options:

  * `windows-latest`
  * `macos-latest`

---

## 5️⃣ `steps:` section

```yaml
steps:
```

* Steps are **executed in order**
* Each step performs **one action**

---

## 6️⃣ Step 1: Checkout code

```yaml
- name: Checkout code
  uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

📌 **What it does:**

* Downloads your **GitHub repository code** into the runner
* Without this step, `hello.py` would **not be available**

✔ Mandatory for almost all workflows

---

## 7️⃣ Step 2: Setup Python

```yaml
- name: Setup Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v4
  with:
    python-version: '3.10'
```

📌 **What it does:**

* Installs **Python 3.10** on the runner
* Sets it as the default Python version

✔ Ensures your code runs with the **correct Python version**

---

## 8️⃣ Step 3: Run Python file

```yaml
- name: Run Python file
  run: python hello.py
```

📌 **What it does:**

* Executes the command:

  ```bash
  python hello.py
  ```
* Runs your Python script inside GitHub’s server

✔ If `hello.py` prints output, it will appear in **Actions logs**

---

## 🔁 Overall Flow (Simple)

```
Push code to GitHub
        ↓
GitHub Actions starts
        ↓
Ubuntu VM created
        ↓
Code is downloaded
        ↓
Python 3.10 installed
        ↓
hello.py is executed
```

---

## ✅ Example `hello.py`

```python
print("Hello from GitHub Actions!")
```

**Output in Actions log:**

```
Hello from GitHub Actions!
```

---

## 🎯 Why this is useful

* Automates **Python script execution**
* Used for:

  * Testing
  * CI pipelines
  * ML model validation
  * Automation tasks
